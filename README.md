# random-scripts
Place I store random useful scripts.


- [transform1.awk](transform1.awk): transforms text files of this form:
```
a
 1
 2
b
 3
```
to output of the form:
```
a:1
a:2
b:3
```
- [ublock-static-filters.txt](ublock-static-filters.txt): custom filters for the uBlock origin browser extension (ad blocker). Currently this just removes certain features I don't want to see on youtube.
